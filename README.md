# Portfolio

This is a companion Repository of the Swift, SwiftUI & Combine Articles posted on [www.paulweichhart.com](https://www.paulweichhart.com)
The project grew quite quickly & gists were getting hard to follow — that's why I created a separate Project to make the code more readable. 

This project is just a Playground for getting started with Combine & SwiftUI — please refer to the Blog Posts to get more insights on the Design & Code decisions.
